Notes:
1. Supports decimal numbers, but the decimal only appears, after the decimal button is pressed, and then another number. 
2. When there is only one operand, it uses the first operand as the second as well.
3. The current number can at any point be switched to a negative number and back. Having said that, a number must first be pressed before you can make it negative/positive
Extras:
	-exponents
	-user can continue operating on result from previous equation.
